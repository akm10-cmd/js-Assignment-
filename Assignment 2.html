<!--------Question 1 -------------

What is the value of clothes[0] and why?

const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]);

Ans-> error
Explanation: clothes is an array of string that has two values. Array indecies the elements from Zero to n-1, first element of an aray on first index. e.g- clothes[0] gives jacket. 
But clothes variable is declared as 'const' that's why we can't re-initialize clothes variable( clothes.length = 0;).
