<!-- Question 1 --------------------
 What will the code below output to the console and why ?

console.log(1 + "2" + "2");
ans-> 122
Explanation: 1 is treated as a integer, "2" & "2" treated as string so + operator perform concatination not addition.

console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
ans-> 32
Explanation: 1 is treated as an integer, +"2" became 2 so, 1 + +"2" = 3
and "2" treated as string so + operator perform concatination not addition.

console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
ans-> 02
Explanation: 1 is treated as an integer, -"1" became -1 so, 1 + -"1" = 0
and "2" treated as string so + operator perform concatination not addition.

console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
ans-> 112
Explanation: +"1" beacame 1,treated as an integer, "1" & "2" treated as string so + operator perform concatination not addition.

console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");
ans-> NaN2
Explanation: we can use only + operator on string, so "A" - "B" is not valid and it gives NaN and after that we concat other string(it is also not valid)then we get NaN2.

console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);
ans-> NaN
Explanation: we can use only + operator on string, so "A" - "B" is not valid and it gives NaN and after that we add 2 and we get NaN.
